## UI/UX designs
### Content and Images
This mock web site is based on official NavigatorCRE website, where most of the images and all of the contents originate from. Background images were free images from other platforms. 

### Mobile Responsive Design
* The elements respond to screen width and sizes

![mobile contact page](readme-pictures/mobile_3.png "NavigatorCRE code challenge") 
![mobile side menu](readme-pictures/mobile_1.png "NavigatorCRE code challenge")
### UX choices 
* Thin side menu with icons
    * Desktop nav bar is thin side bar with icons
        * Page name appears next to the icon as it opens sideway when mouse enters the bar
        * Nav bar closes when mouse leaves the bar
    * Mobile app has button to open the side nav bar
        * Nav bar closes as menu item has been clicked or outside of nav bar has been clicked
* Page scrolls to the top as it renders ]
### UI choices 
* Since Navigator website is themed with NavigatorSRVS, I tried to theme similarly but distinctively as the prompt required redesign of the original
![desktop start page](readme-pictures/start.png "NavigatorCRE code challenge")
![desktop contact page](readme-pictures/contact.png "NavigatorCRE code challenge")
* Themed header with same background and variation in colors
* Each page has its own colored theme
